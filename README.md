# Annual Sales Analysis EDA

## Project Overview

The "Annual Sales Analysis" project involves the analysis of sales data for a XYZ company across 12 different months. The project includes data cleaning, data preprocessing, data exploration, and visualization to answer key business questions related to the sales data.

## Project Tasks

The following tasks were performed during this project:

1. **Data Collection**: Sales data was collected from 12 different CSV files.

2. **Data Merging**: All 12 CSV files were merged into a single CSV to create a consolidated dataset.

3. **Data Cleaning**: Data cleaning was performed to handle missing values (NaN) and ensure data quality.

4. **Data Preprocessing**: Various data preprocessing techniques were applied, including changing column value types, adding new columns, and parsing cells as strings to create new features.

5. **Data Analysis Techniques**:
    - The `.apply()` method was used for data transformation.
    - `groupby` was employed for aggregate analysis.
    
6. **Data Visualization**:
    - Bar charts and line graphs were created to visualize the results.
    - Graphs were labeled for clarity and interpretation.

## Business Questions Explored

The project explored the following high-level business questions related to the sales data:

1. **Best Month for Sales**: Identify the best month for sales and determine the total earnings for that month.
